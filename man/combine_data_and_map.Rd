\title{Combine raw data and plate map to produce a single tall data frame}
\usage{
combine_data_and_map(raw_plate, plate_map, negative_control = 0,
  summary_method = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_plate}{data frame with format matching that produced by a call to 
\code{read_incucyte_exported_to_excel}}

\item{plate_map}{list where each item specifies concentrations, treatments, 
and cell lines for a plate specified in raw_plates, matching the format of a 
file created by \code{read_platemap_from_excel}}

\item{negative_control}{A designation for the negative controls in this 
dataset, if they exist. Value may be NA, a number, a string, or a data frame.

\itemize{
 \item{NA: Use when there are no negative control measurements. The contents 
   of the column named 'value_normalized' will be copied from the contents of 
   the column named 'value'. }
 \item{Number: Use when each treatment has been labeled with a concentration 
   (typically 0) that indicates the vehicle control. Each treatment must 
   contain one or more observations with this concentration, and these 
   observations will be the negative controls.}
 \item{string: Use when a single set of observations is a universal control. 
   The treatment whose name matches the string is the universal 
   negative control all of the data.}
 \item{data frame: Use when more than one negative control exists, and you 
   have to map different treatments to a particular negative control. The 
   data frame must have names 'drug' and 'vehicle', and the data frame will 
   map match treatments in the 'drug' column to those in the 
   'vehicle' column.}
}}

\item{summary_method}{summarize replicate measures by either mean or median; 
must be one of "mean", "median". Defaults to "mean"}
}
\value{
A data frame where columns indicate the sample type, treatment, 
concentration, observed raw value, normalized value, name of the 
negative_control treatment, whether a particular row 
is a negative control for at least one other row, hours since the start time,
and plate of origin. If the data are from a synergy experiment, there will 
be additional columns concententration_2 and treatment_2.
}
\description{
Combine a single data plate matching the output of 
\code{\link{create_empty_plate}} with a plate map matching the output of 
\code{\link{create_empty_plate_map}} to create a single tall data frame with 
one row per observation.
}
\details{
The user specifies which wells (if any) bear negative controls (i.e. 
vehicles)
